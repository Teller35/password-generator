# Password Generator Starter Code
This project is about generating a random password from just a few prompts. The index, style sheet, and basic of js was provided to me in advance.
I started with generatePassword function and wrapped it with the question of length. If within the range takes you further into the function. IF not repeats the question.
Next created my next questions for the users input using true false statements.
Followed by all the if statements with the variables lower, upper, number, or characters.
They each have their own if statement or "true" so as to be added to the password.
This particular part I got stuck on for a while. I had a very hard time getting the right syntax. Once I got the syntax I needed for just the lower then everything else fell into place.
Next on line 38 I started with my finally variable to be filled in for display. Then moved into more if statements to add to the password if true.
Next you will find my for loop with the math random syntax. It runs based off the true or false and creates the password randomly.
I then have it console log and return the password that was just generated into the box.
The rest of the Java file was provided to me.
