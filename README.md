# Password Generator Starter Code
This project is about generating a random password from just a few prompts. The index, style sheet, and basic of js was provided to me in advance.
I started with generatePassword function and wrapped it with the question of length. If within hte range takes you further into the function. IF not repeats the question.
Next created my next question for the users input.
Followed by all the if else statements with the var defined per input.
I then run a for loop to generate a random password in the display box.
